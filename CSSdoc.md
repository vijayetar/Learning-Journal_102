### **Chapter 10 Introducing CSS, page 226**
1. It has two parts - selector and a declaration and selectors.
1. Selectors live in curly brace and it has property and value separated by colon and each property separated by a semi-colon, within curly brackets.
   - Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements
1. Recommend having a separate style sheet and link it *(page 235)* or consider using internal linke *(page236)* or in the head of the document
1. CSS rules cascade
   - last rule matters, so color can changes based on more recent color command, which could be in-line
   - more specific command is given importance
   - add !important after any property value and that will make it more important.

   - Color names (total of 147 predefined colors), eg. DarkCyan
   - *see more details on page 251*
   - Opacity in CSS3 defined as a %age and labelled a, i.e. rgba
