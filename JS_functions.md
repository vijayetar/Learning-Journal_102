# Javascript functions
>## Steps to write a script
1. Define a goal
1. Design the script
1. Code each step
1. Sketch out tasks in a flow chart

>## Script *(page 1-24)*
- Script is made up of statements
- expressions assign values to a variable or are use two or more values to return a single value
- Expressions need **operators** to work, e.g. "=" are **assignment operators**, "+,-,/,*, ++, --, %" are **arithmetic operators** or **string operators**
- **Comparison operators** e.g."> or <"
- **logical operators** e.g. "&"

>## Take home messages *(page 88-91)*
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of the script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function
- The series of statements are a **code block**
- **declaring** function e.g. *function askName(){put logic in here}*
- By giving it a name, you can reuse the function by **calling** it, for e.g. *askName();*
- Pieces of information required to complete a function are **parameters**
- The response of the function is called **return value**
- All functions process but do not have to provide return
- **Name value pairs** are important

>## Parameters vs Arguments *(page 92-94)*
1. first assign a name and **declare** a function to it
1. The function may have fixed value or may need **parameters** entered
1. **call** the function using its name
1. if there are variables in the function, for the function to work properfly, you may have to enter **argument**
1. You could get a single value out of the function or multiple values (called **array**)
