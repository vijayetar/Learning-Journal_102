** Tables in HTML ** pg 130

- Tables are written in HTML using tags *table*
- *tr tags* = table row
- *td tags* = table data
- *th tags* = table heading; these are usually displayed in the middle of the cell and bolded. Use scope to describe row or columm, for example *th scope="col"* and *th scope="row"*
- *td colspan="2"* shows that data spans across two columns
- *td rowspan="2"* shows that data spans across two rows
- Other ways of separating headings and at the bottom by using *thread tags* and *tfoot* respectively
