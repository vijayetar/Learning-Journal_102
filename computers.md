## **What makes a computer a computer?**
- 4 things common to all computers are 
    1. input
    1. storage
    1. process
    1. output
- Input
    - It is telling computers what to do through input devices
    - It is then stoed in memories, accessed by a processor using series of algorithms
    - it continues it for a while until it is Output
- Output 
    - it is variable
    - if connected on the internet, then one computer's output is another computer's input
- Binary & Data
    - electricity stores information using on and off key; this smallest information is called bits
    - Binary system covers numbers, alphabets, colors (rgb), sound, images
    - Information put together are by circuits using logical circuits such as ADDER, AND, NOT, etc.

- Computer parts

    - Input
    - Memory
    - Central processing unit - more complex the information, the more CPU, memory space is needed
    - Output - speaker, 3D computers, cutting tools, etc.
    - Hardware is devices
    - Software is codes, etc

- CPU
    - circuits to do all functions
    - Operating Systems controls all the other programs and how they function together
