# Git vs GitHub
 - Git is the software while Github is the cloud
 - Git is also version control software that is distributed (vs others that are centralized or localized)
 - GitHub allows sharing of files and editing between users while actively keeping track of changes
 - Github is open sourced - ie anyone can make changes and available to all 
 - They both together allow coders to work simultaneously while Git keeps history of all the changes
 - Git allows team members to sync while being remote
 - Git keeps all files in one repository
 
 # How do you use Git?
 - Simply, Git takes snapshots (or commits) in time. This is done with the "add" and "commit", where each commit represents each version of the file. These commits are stored and data is not lost each time. They are stored locally until they are "pushed".
 - To Keep track
   - Each commit (snapshot) has labels
   - HEAD = The label meaning "You Are Here"
   - Use messages to write captions on your commits, that allows us to track changes.
