# **What does Javascript do?**
- HTML defines content
- CSS is the presentation layer
- javascript is the behavioral layer that allows interaction
- this can happen at page upload or user interaction

## **Examples of what we did today**
- We used Javascript to change one of the welcome signs based on time of day (and very interactive)
- For this we both entered it as a separate source file, and as within the html code
\<script>document.write('Welcome!')\</script>

## **How to write a script for web page**
- Keept javascript code in its own Javascript file. They are text files with .js extension
- HTML files \<script> is used to load Javascript file and \<link> to load CSS file
- depending on the size of the script, it can take long for the page to load

## **Rules for javascript**
- A script is a series of instructions and each instruction is called a statement
- It is *case sensitive!!*
- In statements, there are curly braces that indicate *code blocks*
- Data types:
   - Strings in javascript are in '...'
   - Booleans are true/false and take up small amount of memory
   - Numeric data
- Variables use need "declaration" and "=" is assignment operator to give it a value to the operators.
